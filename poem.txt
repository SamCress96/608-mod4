Scamp
(B. Hayes)

You've torn the daily paper
Into a million shreds
And tested the comfort
Of all the beds.
Chased my wool
All over the floor
Hissed and spat
At the dog next door,
And proved yourself
So brave and bold
For a tiny kitten
Only six weeks old.
You're now a black
Little fluffy ball
Curled up tight
Asleep in the hall.
